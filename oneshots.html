		This part of the archives contains a few of the characters I've played in shorter games. Normally these are referred to as one-shots as they are supposed to only last one session, but in my experience such games usually last for two or three. The characters listed here include an elven paladin named Deirdre Tarmlock, a satyr monk named Finnabair, and a dhampir bard named Nadezhda Karovka.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Deirdre was created for a drop-in game that I thought I'd be dropping into more than I actually did, and so I only got to play one game with her. Still, she was a blast: we fought a hydra and a bunch of goblins that session, and while my party focused on the hydra, I got to obliterate everything else. At level six, I was doing enough damage to take out at least one goblin per turn, and being able to cast <em> Misty Step</em> as an oath of ancients paladin meant I was covering ground to the next target really fast. As someone who tends to build more around a character's theme and story than around power, it was a lot of fun to become the most menacing thing on the battlefield after the hydra. This character even got around my usual reluctance to roleplay a paladin's oath, as I figured out a backstory more akin to a warlock's pact in which she swore fealty to an archfey. I don't currently have any character ideas that would make me want to play a paladin again, but I can't deny that she was a lot of fun.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Finnabair was a rare sort of character for me, in two ways: 1) she wasn't my usual choice of an elf, a human, a tiefling, or similar; and 2) I didn't have any sort of backstory in mind when creating or playing her. Even if it's not very fleshed out or just floating around unwritten in my head while I play, pretty much all my other characters have something guiding their roleplay. The reason for this is that she was made for a session that was entirely athletic competitions, and so I made the best character I could for that. My reasoning was that satyrs have a ridiculous bonus to their long and high jump distances, and monks are generally pretty good at most athletic challenges without needing to rely on something temporary like a barbarian's rage ability. Thus, Finnabair was born. I'm not sure that I would play a monk or a satyr again - I don't like most of the abilities monks have and punching a dragon to death tends to break my suspension of disbelief, plus I just love elves too much to give up playing them. But if nothing else, she was effective at what I made her for: she came in first in swimming and horseback archery (despite the hooves!) and second overall in the competition.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Nadezhda was my first time playing a bard, and I loved it. Bards have a reputation for being a little over the top, and I definitely played into that. She was a dhampir, a half-vampire, and I spent most of the game acting on impulse, whether that meant walking through a door via the ceiling or asking party members if I could just have maybe a little bit of blood (please?). She was a bard of the college of swords, however, and I spent most of the combat encounters fighting in melee. I'm not sure if I would enjoy a bard as much if I tried to play it purely as a spell caster, but I definitely want to give it a shot. On the other hand, I'm not sure that I would play a dhampir again: playing up the desire for blood got pretty repetitive, and as someone who cares more about roleplay than mechanics, there isn't much incentive to play a dhampir if I'm not focusing on their hunger. Perhaps it could work in a longer campaign with a slower burn on character development, but at the moment I have plenty of characters I want to try and a dhampir just isn't the priority. The main takeaway from all this for me is that bard was a lot of fun, but the dhampir species suffers in roleplay for shorter-form games.
		</p>

		<p>
		The character sheets of all three of the discussed characters can be found below. However, I have only included their first page. Even though I had ideas for Deirdre's and Nadezhda's backgrounds, I never wrote them down, and I don't consider their spell lists to be important enough to include. Everything of particular relevance can be found on the first page of their character sheets anyways.
