		<h2> Hafwen's Tale </h2>

	<section>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		Hafwen Kendrick, a human warlock of the undying, was the first character I played with my current game group and the first I played after starting hormone replacement therapy. This probably doesn't sound important, but there's a pretty common anecdotal trend among transgender people wherein they tend to play characters that align with their true gender identity. This occurs before even <em> they</em> realize they're trans. Now, I'm not saying that if you're a boy and always play as a girl in a tabletop or video game that you're trans (although, if this is something you do, you might want to maybe examine that a bit; who knows, your life might get a lot happier). But this was absolutely something I did, and Hafwen was the first time I felt like I could be open about myself and my reflection in this character. She's always going to hold a special place in my heart.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		All that said, Hafwen herself was a disaster. She was a classic "king forces his daughter to get married but she's already in love with someone else" kinda gal, with the twist that the person she's in love with is her childhood best friend and personal guard. The king finds out, banishes the knight-slash-girlfriend, and Hafwen runs away to find her - all very fairytale. Unfortunately, our girl is both rather sheltered and doesn't have many people she can trust not to just bring her back to her father. What would you do? Go to the vampire ruling a neighbouring island and offer anything she wants in exchange for some directions and magical power? Because that's what Hafwen did!
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Most of the rest of Hafwen's tale involves a thoroughly absurd series of events in the city of Waterdeep, where her lover was sent and where her new vampire patron has ordered her to uncover a veritable dragon's hoard of embezzled gold coins. She teamed up with an investigator and bard who had an ongoing enemies-to-lovers situation with the captain of the guard, wizard and barbarian brothers trying to escape their criminal family and attend university, a kobold smith who really freaked her out, and a human sorcerer who was above all else just a regular guy who happened to be able to cast magic. Along the way, the party acquired the deed to an abandoned tavern, she found out the magic she'd been gifted had a habit of rapidly rotting the victims it struck, she got asked out by a herbalist and didn't realize til days later, got herself addicted to painkillers, and she accidentally liquefied a person (see the previous statement about her spells). The party also adopted-slash-hired a ghost, an ex-criminal, a kenku, and a quasit to work at the aforementioned tavern, to varying degrees of success.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		The important thing is that Hafwen did actually eventually find her girlfriend, and credit to the game master: roleplaying that scene made me cry in public. The party also hit said girlfriend with five lightning bolts (it's complicated), but everything turned out alright. She even found the hoard of gold, though wasn't able to transport it back to her patron. Instead, she made a new deal, asking the vampire to help her usurp her father in return for making her patron into her viceroy. We wrapped all of that up in an epilogue at the end of the last session, but it would have made for an awesome follow-up campaign.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		All in all, Hafwen was a blast to play. Mechanically, I tried to lean into more necromantic spells and abilities when given the chance, which you can see in the character sheet below. In terms of roleplay, she started out as a shy and awkward girl trying very hard not to let anyone find out who she was (and from that experience, I highly recommend playing a character with a secret they need to keep, but is hard or inconvenient to do so for whatever reason. In Hafwen's case, telling people who she was would have fast-tracked a lot of bureaucracy, for instance). By the end, I had her becoming more and more unhinged, culminating with the decision to usurp her father. Of the characters I've played, she's easily one of my favourites, thanks also in large part to having a great group of people to play with.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Hafwen's character sheet is below. The core information is on the first page, background and roleplay information on the second, and her spell list on the third. It was a pretty short campaign by design, so we only attained level six. Nevertheless, it's high enough level for <em> Inflict Wounds</em> to liquefy a person on a critical hit!
