		<h2> Vetteia's Journey </h2>

	<section>
		<br><br>
		<p>
		Pentavetteia Nevedrian - or just Vetteia, as she usually adds when introducing herself - is the character I'm currently playing, with the same group with whom I played Hafwen. She's a life-domain cleric and, uniquely, a fairy. Now, D&D 5e does have a playable fairy species; however, its size category is small, making it a few feet tall still. And by the gods, if I'm going to play a fairy, I'm going to play one <em> properly</em>. This is how I ended up creating a set of rules for playing as a tiny creature, with permission and review from my group's game master. The results can be found on her character sheet at the bottom of the page.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		As for Vetteia herself, well, she's four-and-one-quarter inches tall, which made fitting her into the world without breaking suspension of disbelief into a pretty fun challenge. For the campaign she's in, we're playing in a setting created by our game master, so I got to establish most of the history of fairies within the setting as well as the community Vetteia lives in and how it fits in with the much larger people around it. I chose to make her a healer so I didn't have to worry too much about the logistics of scale in combat, and this went on to affect her personality as someone who'll do her best to help others no matter how much smaller than them she is. She also can't brute force any problems she might have, and so she has to talk her way through most situations and hope for the best. That being said, she is really good at crawling under doors when the need arises.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Vetteia's main motivation in this campaign has been her partners, a pair of elves whose difference in height has made for some...impolite...conversation at the table. It doesn't help that going from Hafwen, a princess in search of her exiled girlfriend, to a fairy in a throuple has earned me a bit of a reputation with the other players. But despite the jokes at my expense, playing this woman has been a lot of fun. The group's game master got me to cry (again), this time in the very first session when Vetteia was separated from her partners. Most of the focus for her since then has been getting back to them, despite the much more pressing issue of a collection of world-ending magical artifacts resurfacing. Her travelling companions include an elven druid with a mysterious past and an obsession with the stars, a dwarven paladin who started more lawful than good and has become more chaotic than evil, a harengon with an unfortunate case of trauma and lycanthropy, a human monk looking for a way out of the crime syndicate she's involved with, a thri-kreen cleric with an unusually deep knowledge of agriculture, a half-elf scholar with a habit of getting into trouble, a living suit of armour powered by one of those world-ending artifacts, and a firbolg druid who is the most recent addition to the party (some of these characters left and were replaced by another character created by the same player; I promise we don't have ten people crowding around a table).
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		To date, the main events of this campaign include accidentally unleashing an ancient magical plague, unwittingly allowing the thri-kreen to be possessed by a fragment of a dark god, meeting an order of monster hunters in the mountains, stopping the endless rain that threatened to flood a city, losing the paladin's liege-lord first to madness and then to the same dark god, meeting a god of chaos, accidentally letting the god of chaos get his hands on one of the world-ending artifacts, allowing the paladin to swear a new oath in servitude of that god of chaos, saving a ship from the ghost of its former captain, returning to Vetteia's hometown, the king being assassinated, one of Vetteia's partners becoming queen, the three of them getting married, and now most recently, the party setting off again to deal with these recurring artifacts permanently. At the moment we are level seven, and there's no signs the campaign is coming to a close anytime soon. A lot has happened, to put it lightly, and I expect a lot more is still to come.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		As for my experience playing her, Vetteia is mechanically simple despite the need to rewrite some rules. For the most part, I'm casting healing and control spells with a dash of sneaking about when it's needed. Roleplay is something else entirely. While holding a conversation isn't that different from any other character, other interactions are: Vetteia has been nearly crushed both by accident and on purpose a number of times, accused of spying, hidden in a waterskin, had gold offered to the party in exchange for her, been coated in blood, gotten her hands stuck in honey, threatened with being put in a jar by her party, and frequently talked down to literally and figuratively, just to name a few examples. It's gotten me to think a lot about her position in any given encounter, and gets me to think more creatively about how I'll resolve them. She might be the most fun I've ever had with a character in my eight years playing D&D, and a large part of that is just down to her height.

		Vetteia's character sheet can be found below, with core mechanics on the first page, background and roleplay information on the second, and spells on the third. At time of writing, my group is still playing and Vetteia is still alive and mostly well. So far we've reach level seven, though I have no idea how high level this game will go.
